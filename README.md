# Build Instructions

Building from source or modifying the released version is not necessary, as the required tools for Job-OSINT are already included.

# Applications

To keep the release size manageable, most OSINT tools are not pre-installed. However, you can download them using a script on the desktop:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the Desktop folder.
3. Execute the install script: `./install-tools.sh`

# Setup (for building from source)

This build has only been tested on a pre-existing Kali environment, as recommended by Offensive Security.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Hassan125/JobGuard-OSINT.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd JobGuard-OSINT`
3. Run the build script: `sudo ./JobGuard-OSINT-tools.sh`

If successful, a .iso file will be created in `/opt/live-build-config/images`. Use this for live boot, VM installation, or conversion to an OVA file (see https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/converting-to-ova/).
